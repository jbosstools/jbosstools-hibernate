# This file was copied from the build-template.properties

# properties added to reference hibernate core and ext builds
################################

# path to a directory with hibernate3 and hibernateExt source.
hibernatebasedir=C:/work/projects/hibernate/hibernate.sf.net

# location of hibernate core distribution (not source tree!)
# precondition: Hibernate core is successfully built!
hibernate-core.home=${hibernatebasedir}/hibernate-3.0

# location of HibernateExt source directory (not distribution tree!)
# precondition: HibernateExt (console, tools) is successfully built!
hibernate-ext-src.home=${hibernatebasedir}/HibernateExt

# Parameters describing how and where to execute the build.
# Typical users need only update the following properties:
#    baseLocation - where things you are building against are installed
#    bootclasspath - The base jars to compile against (typicaly rt.jar)
#    configs - the list of {os, ws, arch} configurations to build.  
#
# Of course any of the settings here can be overridden by spec'ing 
# them on the command line (e.g., -DbaseLocation=d:/eclipse

############# CVS CONTROL ################
# The CVS tag to use when fetching the map files from the repository
mapVersionTag=HEAD

# The CVS tag to use when fetching elements to build.  By default the
# builder will use whatever is in the maps.  Use this value to override
# for example, when doing a nightly build out of HEAD
# fetchTag=HEAD


############## BUILD / GENERATION CONTROL ################
# The directory into which the build elements will be fetched and where
# the build will take place.
#
# the directory where all files are checkout into, the build is run from
# and where the final product is located.
#
# From pde build article: "On Windows systems, this directory should
# be close to the drive root to avoid path length limitations
# particularly at compile time."
#
# Also, due to eclipse pde build issue 92174, disregard pde build article:
# this MUST be absolute path.
buildDirectory=c:/temp/pdebuild


# Type of build.  Used in naming the build output.  Typically this value is
# one of I, N, M, S, ...
buildType=S

# ID of the build.  Used in naming the build output.
buildId=${BUILDID}

# Label for the build.  Used in naming the build output
buildLabel=${buildType}.${buildId}

# Timestamp for the build.  Used in naming the build output
timestamp=${TIMESTAMP}

# Base location for anything the build needs to compile against.  For example,
# when building GEF, the baseLocation should be the location of a previously
# installed Eclipse against which the GEF code will be compiled.
#
# the directory where an eclipse with all dependent plugins are
# installed.  MUST NOT CONTAIN HIBERNATE PLUGINS! but otherwise
# could be set to ECLIPSE31_HOME.
baseLocation=C:/temp/eclipse/eclipse-3.1M6


#Os/Ws/Arch/nl of the eclipse specified by baseLocation
#baseos
#basews
#basearch
#basenl

# The location underwhich all of the build output will be collected.
collectingFolder=eclipse

# The prefix that will be used in the generated archive.
archivePrefix=${collectingFolder}

# workaround to eclipse issue in org.eclipse.pde.build (as of 3.1M6):
# 90398: workaround:  -DarchivesFormat="*, *, * - zip"
# use zip format until issue 92380 is resolved
archivesFormat=*, *, * - zip

# The list of {os, ws, arch} configurations to build.  This 
# value is a '&' separated list of ',' separate triples.  For example, 
#     configs=win32,win32,x86 & linux,motif,x86
# By default the value is *,*,*
#configs=*,*,* 

#Arguments to send to the zip executable
# zipargs must be set to something!, otherwise no archive is created
# eclipse issue: 92290
zipargs=-q


#Arguments to send to the tar executable
#tarargs=


############# JAVA COMPILER OPTIONS ##############
# The location of the Java jars to compile against.  Typically the rt.jar for your JDK/JRE
bootclasspath=${java.home}/lib/rt.jar

# Whether or not to include debug info in the output jars
javacDebugInfo=false 

# Whether or not to fail the build if there are compiler errors
javacfailonerror=true

# The version of the source code
javacSource=1.4

# The version of the byte code targeted
javacTarget=1.4
