## Install JBoss Tools

Using our own dogfood, we use JBoss Tools as our development environment. JBoss Tools is a set of plugins for the Eclipse platform, so we'll start by obtaining that.

### Get the Eclipse Platform

Download the latest Eclipse platform for your OS from the Eclipse website. We will use the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers. You will find the most current download URL for this on the [Eclipse packages page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).

Install the downloaded artifact according to the instructions for your OS and launch Eclipse using the workspace of your choice.

<img src="images/eclipse-ide-launcher.png" width="600" />

After closing the welcome screen your Eclipse window should look more or less (depending on the OS on which you are working) like the screenshot below.

<img src="images/initial-eclipse-window.png" width="800" />

Now we are ready to add the JBoss Tools plugins.

### Add the JBoss Tools Plugins

<img src="images/add-new-software.png" width="250" />

Start by selecting the 'Add New Software...' menu item from the 'Help' menu as shown above. In the 'Install' wizard that opens, use 'http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/' as the URL in the 'Work with' field and press 'Enter' for the JBoss Tools plugin categories to appear. Push the 'Select All' button to include all the JBoss Tools plugins.

Press the 'Next >' button. The dependencies will be calculated and the details of what will be installed are shown on the second wizard page. 

<img src="images/install-details-plugins.png" width="600" />

You press the 'Next >' button one more time to arrive at the final wizard page where you can review the different licenses.

<img src="images/review-licenses-plugins.png" width="600" />

Choose to accept the licenses for the 'Finish' button to become enabled. Press this button to launch the installation. Be patient, the installation can take a while.
When a popup with a security warning appears informing you about the installation of unsigned software, choose 'Install anyway' to continue the installation.

<img src="images/security-warning.png" width="400" />

The next popup invites you to restart the Eclipse IDE to apply the newly installed plugins. Choose 'Restart Now' and wait for the Eclipse window to reopen.
The JBoss Tools plugins are now installed. However, to be able to develop tests for the Hibernate plugins, we also need to add the JBoss Tools test plugins.

### Add the JBoss Tools Test Plugins

The process to add the JBoss Tools test plugins is completely similar to the previous step. Again, you start by selecting 'Add New Software...' from the 'Help' menu. This time however, in the 'Install' wizard, you need to use 'https://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/development/updates/coretests/' as the URL in the 'Work with' field.

<img src="images/available-software-core-tests.png" width="600" />

Press the 'Next >' button for the installation details to appear.

<img src="images/install-details-core-tests.png" width="600" />

Press 'Next >' again to review and accept the licenses.

<img src="images/review-licenses-core-tests.png" width="600" />

Press 'Finish' to launch the installation and 'Install anyway' in the security warning popup. After restarting, the JBoss Tools test plugins are installed as well and we are ready to import the JBoss Tools Hibernate code base.

## Prepare the JBoss Tools Hibernate Code Base

### Fork the JBoss Tools Hibernate GitHub Repository

Navigate to the [JBoss Tools Hibernate](https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-hibernate) repository on GitHub and use the 'Fork' button in the topright corner of your screen to create a fork in your own github account.

### Create a Local Clone

In a command-line window, navigate to the parent folder of where you want the JBoss Tools Hibernate code base to be cloned and issue the following command :

```
git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-hibernate
```

<img src="images/create-local-clone.png" width="600" />

### Add Your Personal Repository as Remote

Use the command-line to navigate to your fresh local clone and issue the following command :

```
git remote add <remote-name> https://github.com/<your-github-account-name>/jbosstools-hibernate
```

Make sure to replace `<your-github-account-name>` by your GitHub account name and `<remote-name>` with a name of your choice (a good suggestion is to also use your GitHub account name). 

One more thing to do is to fetch the branches of your newly added personal remote repository by issuing the command :

```
git fetch <remote-name>
```
<img src="images/add-personal-repo.png" width="600" />

### Build the Project

We are using [Tycho](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) to build the project. Make sure that Maven is installed and that your Java version is at least 11. You can check your configuration by issuing `mvn version`.

<img src="images/mvn-version.png" width="600" />

Building the project is as simple as issuing `mvn clean install` or `mvn clean verify`. This will include running all the tests of the project. Because this takes a while, you might want to skip this step. Do this by adding the 'skipTests' parameter: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`.

<img src="images/mvn-clean-install.png" width="600" />

Now we are ready to import the project into our JBoss Tools installation.

## Import the JBoss Tools Hibernate Code Base

In the fresh JBoss Tools workbench that you installed earlier, open the Eclipse import wizard e.g. using the 'File > Import...' menu. On the 'Select' page of the wizard, select the 'Maven -> Existing Maven Projects' and afterwards push the 'Next >' button. 

<img src="images/import-select.png" width="400" />

On the 'Maven Projects' page of the wizard, use the 'Browse...' button to navigate to the root folder of your local JBoss Tools Hibernate clone that you created previously.

<img src="images/import-maven-projects.png" width="400" />

Just accept the defaults and make sure everything is selected. Push the 'Finish' button to start the import. At the end of the process a new popup window will appear inviting you to set up Maven plugin connectors that are lacking. 

<img src="images/m2e-connectors-discover.png" width="400" />

A m2e connector for the Maven Dependency plugin is not installed. Push the 'Finish' button to launch the discovery process for this plugin. After some time the 'Install' wizard appears.

<img src="images/m2e-connectors-install.png" width="600" />

Push the 'Next >' button to arrive at the 'Install Details' page of the wizard.

<img src="images/m2e-connectors-install-details.png" width="600" />

Push the 'Next >' button again to arrive at the 'Review Licenses' page of the wizard.

<img src="images/m2e-connectors-review-licenses.png" width="600" />

Accept the license and push the 'Finish' button to launch the installation of the plugin in the workbench. After a while, we get the security warning that we still know from the JBoss Tools installation earlier.

<img src="images/security-warning.png" width="400" />

Push the 'Install anyway' button and when invited restart the workbench to apply the changes by pushing the 'Restart Now' button.

When the workbench reopens, you will need to wait some time for the Maven projects to be updated and rebuild. After that you will be ready to work on the source code. 

<img src="images/final-eclipse-window.png" width="800" />

Congratulations! You have succesfully imported the JBoss Tools Hibernate code base. In the next section, we will talk more about how to contribute the changes you make.

## Contributing Code

### Create a Topic Branch

All changes to the JBoss Tools Hibernate code base have to be related to a bug, task or new feature that was registered in the [JBoss Tools JIRA repository](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/JBIDE). All the issues in this repository are identified by an identifier of the form 'JBIDE-XXXXX' where the X's represent the issue number. A good practice is to create a topic branch in your local code base with the same name as the identifier of the issue you are working on. You can do this in from a command-line prompt. When you are on the master branch, use:

```
git checkout -b JBIDE-XXXXX
```

Now you are ready to do the modifications you need. 

### Modify or Add Some Code

The main thing to think about when you are adding code or doing modifications is that the increments should be small and sizable. Ideally and in line with the test driven development methodology, you write a test that illustrates the changes you are making of the new feature that you are implementing along with the proposed changes. When you are happy with your changes, you create a commit on your topic branch making sure that you use the -s flag to sign off the commit and the -m flag to add a comment. This comment should always begin with the identifier of the JIRA issue that you are working on and include the title of the issue. If the one commit does not completely solve or implement the issue, you can add a description of the particular changes in the commit comment.

```
git add .
git commit -s -s "JBIDE-XXXXX: <JBoss Tools Hibernate issue summary> - <Description of the changes>"
```

### Create a Pull Request

Ideally, you only submit one commit per pull request. You can always can squash multiple commits into one if needed. To create the pull request, push your changes to your personal remote repository on GitHub.

```
git push <remote-name> JBIDE-XXXXX
```

You can then use a browser to navigate to your GitHub page (https://github.com/koentsje/jbosstools-hibernate/pulls). The recently pushed branch should be listed. Push the 'Compare & pull request' button and on the next page the 'Create pull request' button to create the pull request.

One of the JBoss Tools Hibernate developers will then review your pull request and accept it when everything is OK or give some feedback when there are things that need to be adapted.
